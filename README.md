The application uses Clean Architecture based on MVVM and Repository patterns. Implemented
Architecture principles follow Google recommended [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide).

![Guide to app architecture](screenshots/guide-to-app-architecture.png "Guide to app architecture")

The application is written entirely in Kotlin.

Android Jetpack is used as an Architecture glue including but not limited to ViewModel, LiveData,
Lifecycles, Navigation, Room and Data Binding. See a complete list in "Libraries used" section.

The application does network HTTP requests via Retrofit, OkHttp and GSON. Loaded data is saved to
SQL based database Room, which serves as single source of truth and support offline mode.
Paging library is used for data pagination online and offline.

Kotlin Coroutines manage background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
Combination of Coroutines and Kotlin build in functions (transformation, collections) are preferred
over RxJava 2.

Work manager does synchronisation job being compatible with Doze Mode and using battery efficiently.
Navigation component manages in-app navigation.

Dagger 2 is used for dependency injection.

Glide is used for image loading and Timber for logging.

Stetho is used to empower debugging skills (like Network calls log, Database content overview,
UI Hierarchy view, etc).

A sample app consist of 3 screens: List of LEGO® themes, list of sets and set details.

Getting Started
---------------
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

There are two Gradle tasks for testing the project:
* `connectedAndroidTest` - for running Espresso on a connected device
* `test` - for running unit tests

Libraries Used
--------------

The application goal is to show case current Android Architecture state using out of box
Android tools made by Google (Android Jetpack) and 3rd party community driven libraries.

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arranges them into four
categories:

Android Studio IDE setup
------------------------
For development, the latest version of Android Studio is required. The latest version can be
downloaded from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

App uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.
Here's how to configure it for use with Android Studio (instructions adapted
from the ktlint [README](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md)):

- Close Android Studio if it's open

- Download ktlint using these [installation instructions](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#installation)

- Inside the project root directory run:

  `./ktlint --apply-to-idea-project --android`

- Start Android Studio
